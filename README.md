# PHP development in a devcontainer with preinstalled code quality tools

Set of files for starting VSCode in *devcontainer* mode and writing PHP codebase. Several static code analysis tools such as php-cs-fixer, phpcbf, SonarLint and others are preinstalled.

Let's imagine one of the following situations: 

1. You are working with several people on the same PHP project and you notice that one or other person does not comply with your quality criteria when it comes to the layout of the code. You like to use four spaces for indentation, you want the brace that marks the start of a function to be on the line, you don't want to see any more useless spaces at the end of the line, ... and damned! you notice that some people don't care about this.
   
2. You are working alone on a project and don't want to lose time to configure your VSCode experience. You wish to start very quickly with a lot of tools already installed in VSCode so you can put your focus to the code, not the editor.

The ultimate solution: using a `devcontainer` in VSCode.

By using a **devcontainer**, you (and your team colleague) will use a preinstalled environment and everyone will have exactly the same. You'll save yourself a lot of time by not having to configure your system, and you'll be able to start coding straight away, supported by a range of quality analysis tools.
